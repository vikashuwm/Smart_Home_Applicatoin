# Smart_Home_Applicatoin

Project Overview: Smart Home Automation System
This system will manage various smart devices in a home, such as lights, thermostats, security cameras, and entertainment systems. The system will allow for control and monitoring of these devices via a central application.

Components and Design Patterns
Singleton:

Component: Central Controller
Usage: Ensure there's only one instance of the Central Controller managing all smart devices.
Factory Method:

Component: Device Factory
Usage: Create various types of smart devices (e.g., Light, Thermostat, Camera) without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
Abstract Factory:

Component: Device Family Factory
Usage: Provide an interface to create families of related or dependent objects like different types of lights (LED, Fluorescent), cameras (IP Camera, CCTV), etc.
Builder:

Component: Home Configuration
Usage: Construct a complex Home configuration step by step (e.g., setting up rooms, installing devices in each room).
Prototype:

Component: Device Cloning
Usage: Clone existing device configurations to create new devices with the same settings.
Adapter:

Component: Third-Party Device Integration
Usage: Allow incompatible third-party devices to be controlled through the Central Controller.
Bridge:

Component: Device Abstraction
Usage: Separate the device interface from the implementation, enabling devices to be controlled independently of their interface.
Composite:

Component: Room Management
Usage: Treat individual devices and groups of devices (rooms) uniformly.
Decorator:

Component: Device Features
Usage: Add additional features to devices dynamically, such as adding a motion detector to a light.
Facade:

Component: User Interface
Usage: Provide a simplified interface for the user to interact with the system, hiding the complexities of the subsystem interactions.
Flyweight:

Component: Device States
Usage: Efficiently manage a large number of similar device states, such as on/off states for lights.
Proxy:

Component: Remote Device Control
Usage: Control devices remotely through a proxy, handling communication and access control.
Chain of Responsibility:

Component: Event Handling
Usage: Pass requests for device actions through a chain of handlers (e.g., security check, power check, user authentication).
Command:

Component: Command Execution
Usage: Encapsulate requests as command objects that can be executed, queued, and logged.
Interpreter:

Component: Scripting Language
Usage: Interpret and execute home automation scripts written in a custom language.
Iterator:

Component: Device Collection
Usage: Provide a way to access devices in a collection (e.g., all devices in a room) sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.
Mediator:

Component: Device Communication
Usage: Facilitate communication between devices, ensuring they interact in a decoupled manner.
Memento:

Component: Device Configuration Backup
Usage: Capture and restore the state of devices, allowing the system to revert to a previous state.
Observer:

Component: Device State Monitoring
Usage: Notify interested parties (e.g., user interface, logging system) of changes in device states.
State:

Component: Device Behavior
Usage: Allow devices to change behavior based on their state (e.g., a thermostat can have states like idle, heating, cooling).
Strategy:

Component: Device Control Algorithms
Usage: Define different control algorithms for devices (e.g., different strategies for heating control).
Template Method:

Component: Device Initialization
Usage: Define the skeleton of an algorithm for device initialization, allowing subclasses to define specific steps.
Visitor:

Component: Device Reporting
Usage: Perform operations like generating reports on various devices without changing the device classes.
